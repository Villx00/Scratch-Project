# Scratch-Project
A simple block breaker game i made in scratch as per the instructions of problem set 0 in the Harvard CS50X course
Use the directional buttons to move the paddle sprite. The game will stop and display a "Game Won" Sprite once all blocks are broken and the ball sprite is in contact with the paddle sprite.
