# Scratch-Project
A simple brick breaker game i made in scratch as per the instructions of problem set 0 in the Harvard CX50 course
Use the directional buttons to move the paddle sprite. The game will stop and display a "Game Won" Sprite once all bricks are broken and the ball sprite is in contact with the paddle sprite.
